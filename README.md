# Simple abstraction to communicate with BQ2040 chip

This is an old personal project that I am now making public. It is an abstraction designed to handle BQ chips in a more efficient and user-friendly manner.

Key features of this project include:

- Sending commands to BQ chips
- Reading from and writing to the EEPROM memory

Now you can reset your battery.

## How to use
Compile the hw_interface.ini and flash the binary in the arduino.
Run the CLI and stablish the commutation with arduino by serial port.
```
# run help the command help to see the available commands

help
``` 

```
# simple example

read_eepron 0X12
```
